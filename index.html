                               <h3>10 of Their Most Essential Songs;</h3>
          </div>
      <ol class="list""">
                        <li><strong>“Killing an Arab” </strong> (from Boys Don’t Cry, 1978)
More pop singles should reference the literary genius of Albert Camus (“Arab”), Emily Brontë (Kate Bush’s “Wuthering Heights”), and James Joyce (Bush’s “The Sensual World,” which, incidentally, was one of head-Cure Robert Smith’s favorite songs when it was released the same year as Disintegration). It’s hard to fathom that Bush was only 18 when she wrote “Wuthering Heights” and Smith merely one year older when The Cure released the Smith-penned “Arab” as a single.</li>
                        
                  <li><strong>“M” </strong> (from Seventeen Seconds, 1980)
My favorite use ever of the 13th letter of the alphabet. (No offense to Fritz Lang and Dame Judi Dench!)</li>
                        <li><strong>“Other Voices”</strong>(from Faith, 1981)
Eighties music might be most fondly remembered for giving us, among other things, MTV, new-wave, Madonna, and Michael Jackson, but The Cure offered three post-punk classics (1980’s Seventeen Seconds, 1981’s Faith, and 1982’s Pornography) before Jackson even got around to Thriller.</li>
                                          <li><strong>“Splintered in Her Head”</strong> (B-side of “Charlotte Sometimes,” 1981)
She wasn’t the only one! I used to go to parties during my freshman year at UF and entertain fellow revelers by singing Cure B-sides, including “Throw Your Foot,” “Mr. Pink Eyes,” “A Man Inside My Mouth,” and this, despite the fact that I didn’t know — and still don’t — what the hell Robert Smith was singing.
</li>
                                          <li><strong>“One Hundred Years”</strong>  (from Pornography, 1982)
Nearly seven minutes of pure musical catharsis that, unlike any man I’ve ever known and probably ever will, still makes my heart beat faster every time it re-enters my life, more than 30 years after the first time.</li>
                        
                                          <li><strong>“The Figurehead”</strong>  The Cure (from Pornography, 1982)
The fifth track on The Cure’s fourth studio album (my favorite until the arrival of Disintegration, which was the second part of an unofficial trilogy that included Faith and Bloodflowers, though I’d say Pornography, not Faith, should kick off the threesome), this is also notable for forcing me to consult a dictionary to look up the meaning of the word “figurehead.”</li>
                        
                                          <li><strong>“The Caterpillar” </strong> (from The Top, 1984)
Five years before “Love Song” became The Cure’s biggest U.S. hit, another sad-ish love song took them to number 14 on the UK singles chart. “You flicker/And you’re beautiful/You glow inside my head/You hold me hypnotized/I’m mesmerized/Your flames/The flames that kiss me dead.” That’s amore.</li>
      <li><strong> “Close to Me”</strong>(from The Head on the Door, 1985)
If I listen to this once, chances are I’ll listen to it at least a half-dozen more times and be blown away by the intricate and sophisticated musicianship with every repeat. The combo of Smith’s vocals, which sound like he’s being smothered under a pillow in another room, the horn arrangement (in your face and way up in your ears on the single remix), and how it pulls off both minimalist and densely textured at the same time was college-rock nirvana half a decade before grunge Nirvana. I still wish Adele had covered this and not “Lovesong” on 21.</li>
                        <li><strong> “Like Cockatoos” </strong> (from Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, 1987)
A tribute to my favorite bird and rocking proof that pop and musical complexity need not be mutually exclusive. </li>     
                        <li><strong>"Plainsong"</strong>  (from Disintegration, 1989)
Inspired by the way director Sofia Coppola incorporated it into her 2006 film Marie Antoinette, my best friend used the intro for the opening track of The Cure’s most-accomplished album in her wedding in 2012. I once read a review that described it as sounding “like glass breaking in motion.” How I wish I’d written that first. </li>
